# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine using its chemical properties.
The objective is to:
Analyze physicochemical featuresUnderstand feature relationships
Train multiple ML models
Improve performance through tuning
Select the best-performing algorithm
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline.

# 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of numerical features describing wine samples.
🧪 Features
Feature	Description
Fixed Acidity	Non-volatile acids in wine
Volatile Acidity	Acetic acid content
Citric Acid	Freshness indicator
Residual Sugar	Remaining sugar after fermentation
Chlorides	Salt content
Free Sulfur Dioxide	SO₂ before binding
Total Sulfur Dioxide	Total SO₂
Density	Wine density
pH	Acidity level
Sulphates	Wine preservative
Alcohol	Alcohol percentage

# 🎯 Target Variable: Quality (Score 0–10)
🧠 Problem Type
This can be solved as:

🔹 Regression → Predict exact quality score

🔹 Classification → Classify wine as Good / Bad
This project treats it as a Supervised Learning problem.
